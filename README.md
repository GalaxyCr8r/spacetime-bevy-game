This repository is entirely experimental. I have no plans for it besides learning the tools. I'm simply jumping straight in to test and demonstrate the connection between a SpacetimeDB server and a BevyEngine client. With absolutely zero experience in either, including the Rust language. I'm enjoying myself believe it or not.
